# job-finder-py
## Overview
So I wanted to create a small project that would scrape the websites with a list of companies (like https://www.angel.co/companies,
and then look for internship positions, because I was massively applying for internships. I used `selenium` amd `requests`. I
made some progress with scraping, however, then I stumbled upon this link in my output: https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx.

I decided not to joke around and put this project on hold. I will need to do a bit more research about the legal aspect of it.
I also want to make sure that I know where that link has come from ðŸ˜›
